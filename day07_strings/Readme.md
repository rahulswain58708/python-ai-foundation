# Python Strings Practice 🧵🐍

This repository contains my **hands-on practice and logic-building exercises** for the **Python Strings chapter**.

The goal of this practice is to build a **strong foundation in string manipulation**, which is essential for **data processing, AI, and NLP-based systems**.

## 🚀 Project Included

### 🔹 Smart Text Analyzer
A menu-driven Python program that:
- Cleans text
- Counts words and characters
- Finds vowels and longest word
- Checks word existence
- Removes duplicate characters

(Project is maintained in a **separate folder**.)
