# Python Operators – Practice Exercises

This folder contains my **Python Operators practice** as part of my **Python AI Foundation** learning journey.

The goal of this chapter is to build **strong logical thinking** using different types of operators, which are essential for decision-making in programming and Artificial Intelligence.

---

## 📌 Topics Covered

- Arithmetic Operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `//`, `**`)
- Comparison Operators (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`)
- Logical Operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)
- Assignment Operators (`=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`)
- Membership Operators (`in`, `not in`)
- Identity Operators (`is`, `is not`)

---

## 🧪 Practice Highlights

- Input-based problems
- Real-world logic examples
- Boolean logic handling
- Correct use of `==` vs `is`
- Assignment operator updates
- String membership checks

A total of **18+ practice questions** were solved to ensure strong conceptual clarity.

## 🎯 Learning Outcome

After completing this chapter, I can:
- Apply operators correctly in real programs
- Combine operators with conditions
- Avoid common logical mistakes
- Write clean and readable Python logic

These skills are critical for:
- Conditional statements
- Data filtering
- Rule-based AI logic

---

## 🚀 Next Step

Move to **Conditional Statements (if–else)** and apply operators in decision-making scenarios.
