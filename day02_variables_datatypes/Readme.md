# Day 02 – Variables & Data Types in Python

This folder contains my **Day 2 Python practice** focused on understanding **variables and data types**, which are the foundation of all programming and AI-related work.

---

## 📌 Topics Covered
- Variables in Python
- Dynamic typing
- Data Types:
  - Integer (`int`)
  - Float (`float`)
  - String (`str`)
  - Boolean (`bool`)
- `type()` function
- Type Casting
- User Input

---

## 🎯 Goal of Day 2
Build a **strong understanding of how data is stored, identified, and converted** in Python.

This knowledge is critical for:
- Data preprocessing
- Handling user input
- Working with datasets in AI and Machine Learning

---

## 🧠 Learning Outcome
After completing this day, I can:
- Create and update variables confidently
- Identify data types using `type()`
- Convert data types using type casting
- Handle numeric input correctly
