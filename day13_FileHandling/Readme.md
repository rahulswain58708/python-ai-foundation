# 📂 Python File Handling Practice

This repository contains my **complete Python File Handling practice**, starting from basic concepts to real-world mini projects.  
I created this as part of my journey to become an **AI Engineer**, focusing on writing clean, safe, and practical Python code.

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

Through this practice, I learned how to:

- Create, read, write, and append files in Python
- Use different file modes (`r`, `w`, `a`)
- Work with the `with` statement (best practice)
- Handle files safely using the `os` module
- Build small real-world applications using file handling
- Write structured and readable Python code
