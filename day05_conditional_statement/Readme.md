# Python Conditional Statements – Practice & Projects

This folder contains my complete learning and practice of **Conditional Statements (if–else)** in Python as part of my **Python AI Foundation** journey.

The goal of this chapter was to build **strong decision-making logic**, which is essential for real-world programming and Artificial Intelligence.

---

## 📌 Topics Covered

- `if` statement
- `if–else`
- `if–elif–else`
- Nested `if` statements
- Comparison operators in conditions
- Logical operators (`and`, `or`)
- Input validation using conditions

## 🧪 Practice Highlights

- Positive / Negative / Zero check  
- Even or Odd  
- Voting eligibility  
- Grade system  
- Divisibility checks  
- Login system (nested conditions)  
- Country-based eligibility  
- Input validation  
- Discount system  

A total of **15 condition-based problems** were solved, including **nested conditions** and **real-world logic**.

## 🎯 Mini Project Included

### 🔹 Mood2Emoji – Mood Based Emoji Recommender
A fun Python project where the user enters their mood and the program recommends emojis based on conditional logic.

**Concepts used:**
- Strings
- Conditions
- User input
- Logical decision making

## 🧠 Learning Outcome

After completing this chapter, I can:
- Write clean and correct conditional logic
- Handle edge cases properly
- Use nested conditions confidently
- Build small real-world programs using decisions

These skills are critical for:
- Rule-based systems
- AI logic
- Data validation
- Future Machine Learning workflows
