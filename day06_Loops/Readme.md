# Python Loops – Practice Exercises

This folder contains my **Python Loops practice exercises**, created as part of my **Python AI Foundation** learning journey.

The purpose of these practice files is to build **strong loop logic**, improve problem-solving skills, and gain confidence in repetition-based programming.

---

## 📌 Topics Covered

- `for` loop basics
- `while` loop usage
- `range()` function
- Loop counters and accumulators
- `break` statement
- `continue` statement
- Nested loops
- Pattern printing
- Logical problem solving using loops

---

├── 04_break&continue_practice.py
├── 05_Nested_loop_practice.py
└── README.md

Each file focuses on **one specific loop concept** to keep learning structured and easy to understand.

## 🧪 Practice Highlights

- Printing numbers using loops  
- Even and odd number logic  
- Multiplication tables  
- Sum and factorial calculations  
- Loop control using break & continue  
- Star and number patterns using nested loops  

These exercises help strengthen **logical thinking** and prepare for real-world programming tasks.

## 🎯 Learning Outcome

After completing these practice problems, I am able to:
- Confidently use `for` and `while` loops
- Control loop execution flow
- Write nested loops for complex patterns
- Apply loops to solve logical problems
- Build a strong foundation for AI and data processing

## 🚀 Next Step

Apply loops in **real-world mini projects** and move forward to the **Strings chapter**.
