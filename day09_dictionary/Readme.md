📘 Python Dictionary Practice (Beginner → Advanced)

This repository contains my complete practice of Python Dictionary concepts, solved step by step from basic to advanced level.

The goal of this practice was not to memorize syntax, but to build strong logic and real problem-solving skills, which are essential for becoming an AI Engineer.

🚀 What I Practiced in This Repository

✅ Dictionary Basics

Creating dictionaries

Accessing values using keys

Safe access using .get()

Adding and updating key–value pairs

Deleting dictionary items

🔁 Looping & Key Checks

Looping through keys

Looping through values

Looping through key–value pairs using .items()

Checking if a key exists

Counting dictionary elements using logic

🧩 Dictionary with List & Tuple

Dictionary with list as values (marks list)

Calculating total and average from list values

Dictionary with tuple as values

Tuple unpacking from dictionary values

Identifying dictionary keys whose values are lists

🧠 Logic-Based Dictionary Problems

Finding the topper student (without using max())

Creating Pass / Fail dictionaries using percentage logic

Searching for a key in a dictionary

Counting students above a specific score

Finding the key with the highest value

Reversing a dictionary (key ↔ value)

Creating dictionaries from user input

Frequency counting using dictionary

🎯 Learning Approach

❌ No shortcut functions (max(), min(), sorted())

❌ No dictionary comprehension (for learning clarity)

✅ Used loops, conditions, and clean logic

✅ Focused on understanding why, not just how

🧠 Why This Matters

This practice helped me:

Think in key–value structure

Build confidence in data handling

Prepare for real-world applications

Strengthen the foundation required for AI & ML engineering

🔜 What’s Next

Dictionary Mini Project (Contact Manager) ✅

Learn set data structure

Move toward functions & file handling

Build more logic-based projects

🙌 Final Note

This repository represents real progress, not rushed learning.
Every problem here was solved with logic and understanding.

“Strong foundations build strong systems.”
