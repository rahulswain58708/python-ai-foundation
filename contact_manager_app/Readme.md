📞 Contact Manager App (Python CLI)

A simple Contact Manager application built using Python Dictionary.
This project runs completely in the terminal (CLI) and helps users manage contacts efficiently.

🚀 Project Objective

Build a Python application that allows users to:

Add contacts

View all contacts

Search contacts

Update contacts

Delete contacts

The project is developed using pure Python logic with no external libraries.

🧱 Data Structure Used
contacts = {
    "Rahul": 9876543210,
    "Amit": 9123456780
}


Key → Contact Name (unique)
