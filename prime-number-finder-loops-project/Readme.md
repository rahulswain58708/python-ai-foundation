# Prime Number Finder 🔢

This is a Python mini project that finds **all prime numbers within a user-defined range** using loops and conditional logic.

The project is built to strengthen **loop concepts**, **nested loops**, and **algorithmic thinking**.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

- Take a **starting number** from the user
- Take an **ending number** from the user
- Find and display all **prime numbers** between the given range
- Display the **total count** of prime numbers found

---

## 🧠 How the Program Works

1. User enters:
   - Start number
   - End number
2. The program checks each number in the range
3. For every number:
   - It checks divisibility using a nested loop
   - If divisible → not prime
   - If not divisible → prime
4. All prime numbers are printed
5. Total prime count is displayed at the end

---

## 🧪 Example Output

Enter Start Number: 2
Enter End Number: 6

Prime Numbers Between 2 and 6:
2
3
5

Total prime numbers found: 3

## 🛠 Concepts Used

- `for` loops
- Nested loops
- Conditional statements
- Boolean flag (`is_prime`)
- `break` statement
- Counters
- User input handling

## 🎯 Learning Outcome

After completing this project, I gained confidence in:
- Writing loop-based algorithms
- Using nested loops effectively
- Solving mathematical problems programmatically
- Applying logic instead of memorizing syntax

This project strengthens the foundation required for **AI, data processing, and problem solving**.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Optimize prime checking (square root method)
- Add input validation
- Display prime numbers in a list format
- Convert into menu-driven program
