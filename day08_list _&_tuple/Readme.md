# Python Lists & Tuples Practice 🐍📚

This repository contains my **hands-on practice code** for the **Python Lists & Tuples chapter**, focused on **logic building and core data structure understanding**.

The goal of this practice is to strengthen Python fundamentals that are essential for **AI, Machine Learning, and Data Handling**.


*(File names may vary based on practice questions)*
