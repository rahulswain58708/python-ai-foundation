🧠 Python Set Practice – From Basics to Advanced

A structured collection of Python Set practice problems, solved step-by-step from basic to advanced level to build strong conceptual understanding and logical thinking.

This repository focuses on:

Concept clarity

Logical problem solving

Real-world usage of Python sets

This practice is part of my AI Engineering learning journey and foundation-building in Python.

📌 Topics Covered
🔹 Set Basics

Creating sets

Removing duplicate values

Creating empty sets

Membership checking using in

Looping through sets

🔹 Set Operations

Union

Intersection

Difference

Symmetric Difference

Subset checking

Disjoint checking

🔹 Logic & Practice Problems

Counting elements without using len()

Finding minimum & maximum without min() / max()

Extracting even numbers from a set

Detecting duplicate values using sets

Removing duplicate characters from a string

Counting unique words in a sentence

🔹 Real-World Use Cases

Attendance tracking (Day-1 & Day-2)

Finding students attending both classes

Finding students attending only one class

Comparing two lists using set logic

🧑‍💻 Learning Rules Followed

No shortcut functions unless required

No list/set comprehensions

Used loops and conditional logic

Focused on understanding, not memorization
