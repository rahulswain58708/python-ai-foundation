**📘 Python Set Practice**

This repository contains my **Python Set practice questions**, solved step by step from **basic to advanced level** to build strong understanding and logic.

The focus of this practice is **concept clarity, problem solving, and real-world usage** of sets.

---

## Topics Covered

### Set Basics

* Creating sets
* Removing duplicate values
* Empty set creation
* Membership checking using `in`
* Looping through sets

---

### Set Operations

* Union
* Intersection
* Difference
* Symmetric Difference
* Subset and Disjoint checks

---

### Logic & Practice

* Counting elements without using `len()`
* Finding minimum and maximum without `min()` / `max()`
* Extracting even numbers from a set
* Detecting duplicate values using sets
* Removing duplicate characters from a string
* Counting unique words in a sentence

---

### Real-World Use Cases

* Attendance tracking (Day-1 & Day-2)
* Finding students attending both classes
* Finding students attending only one class
* Comparing two lists using set logic

---

## Learning Rules Followed

* No shortcut functions unless required
* No list/set comprehensions
* Used loops and conditional logic
* Focused on understanding, not memorizing
