# Smart Text Analyzer 🧠📄

Smart Text Analyzer is a **menu-driven Python project** that analyzes and processes user-provided text using core string concepts.

This project is built as part of my **Python learning journey for AI/ML**, focusing on **logic building, text preprocessing, and clean program design**.

## 🚀 Features

- Convert text to lowercase
- Remove extra spaces from text
- Count total words
- Count total characters (excluding spaces)
- Count vowels
- Find the longest word
- Check if a specific word exists
- Remove duplicate characters (order preserved)
- View cleaned text
- Menu-driven user interaction

---

## 🛠 Concepts Used

- String methods (`lower`, `split`, `join`, `replace`, `strip`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- Conditional statements
- Input validation
- Menu-driven program logic
- Clean code structure

## 🧪 How It Works

1. User enters a paragraph or sentence
2. Program cleans the text (lowercase + extra space removal)
3. User selects options from the menu
4. Program returns results based on the selected option
5. User can perform multiple operations on the same text

## 🎯 Learning Outcome

- Strong understanding of Python strings
- Improved logic-building skills
- Experience with real-world text preprocessing
- Confidence to move to Lists, Tuples, and NLP concepts
